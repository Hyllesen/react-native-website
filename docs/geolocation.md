To use geolocation in React Native you can import the [official react native geolocation package](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-geolocation), or other third-party geolcation packages:

[react-native-geolocation-service](https://github.com/Agontuk/react-native-geolocation-service) </br>
[react-native-location](https://github.com/timfpark/react-native-location)

In earlier versions of React Native the geolocation was available through the <b>navigator.geolocation</b> global, but has now been separated out.
